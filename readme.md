# Skratchpad

## About

Skratchpad is a simple looper patch for Pure Data that responds to timecode vinyl control and MIDI inputs. 
Samples can be loaded and played back at different rates based on the speed of the controlling turntable.
Cue points and mutes can be triggered using MIDI controllers. 

## Requirements

This patch depends on vinylcontrol~ from Niklas Klugel:

## Status

This is a work in progress. You'll have to map your MIDI controller manually to trigger the cue points
and you might have to change things based on the brand of timecode record you have and/or the 
particular audio interface you are using.
